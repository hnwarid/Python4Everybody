# Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:

# x = 43
# x = x + 1
# print(x)

# a) 43
# b) 44
# c) x + 1
# d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

# the answer is 44 because the second line is a new assignment statement for x
# that binds its previous value (43) with another value (1)
