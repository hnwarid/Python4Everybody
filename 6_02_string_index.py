# Exercise 2: Given that fruit is a string, what does fruit[:] mean?
fruit = "banana"
print(fruit)
print(fruit[:])

# Output:
# banana
# banana

# fruit[:] means the fruit variable will be iterated from first index 0 to the last -1
# so it's the same as if the fruit variable gets printed without the slicing
